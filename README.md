# ProfessionalNetworkApplication
[CS 166] Database Management Systems Project

Simple Professional Network Application with a friendly User Interface
which uses a database to support efficient data management.

This project was done in groups of two.
My job consisted of implementing the user interface and a basic client (Java console application.)

The basic client included many functionalities that of an online
messenger such as new user registration, login/logout, password change,
update profile, send friend request, view friends, send/view messages.

ProfNetwork.java is where most of the implementation was done. It includes
an embedded SQL utility class that is designed to work with PostgreSQL 
JDBC drivers.

Final Project Documentation includes implementation/design details 
and technical difficulties we ran into.
